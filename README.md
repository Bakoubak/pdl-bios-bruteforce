# Pays de la Loire UEFI Brute-force
This UEFI setup password brute-force is made as an attempt to crack the password on Pays de la Loire laptops, which are HP laptops distributed to high-schoolers in their first year. Those are BIOS locked and no admin access whatsoever is provided until you finish your school years.

> They are managed from InTune, so the IT department of the region can override the password at any time

The main language used for this purpose is C++, it is based on HP CMSL and its PowerShell scripts that can be found on HP's website:
